Regularization is using the least complext model
this is evaluated by using the model that has less non-zero (or close) weights

LASSO - complexity is expressed as the sum of absolute values of weights
Ridge - expressed as the sum of the square of weights
elasticnet - captured by a combination of the two techniques above
